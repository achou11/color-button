# Color Button

It's pretty simple:
- Type the color of your choice
    - Anything from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) should work
- Press the 'Enter' key or the circular button to actually change the color
- Press the 'Escape' key or the reset button to revert back to the default

Enjoy!
